SharePoint Continues Integration with PowerShell

Continues Integration is a key factor to having a productive build environment. It allows developers to focus on more important (or creative) tasks and also a means of having the same deployment experience in every environment.

Below are some of the main features of this deployment script.

- A trustable script that can handle common gotchas
- Extendable both at the script level and configuration
- Readable and easy to learn configuration XML
- Ability to handle pre / post deployment tasks
- Logging and Exception handling
- Assembly isolation (via sessions) to prevent version conflicts during deployment
